# uqdl

Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Learning.

## Description

This repository has all code in the `uqdl.ipynb` notebook and outlines some different approaches to using neural
networks to model both uncertainty inherent to the data (aleatory uncertainty) and uncertainty stemming from inadequate
modelling (epistemic uncertainty).

Aleatory uncertainty modelling is a somewhat solved problem whereas the problem of
converting epistemic uncertainty into aleatory uncertainty is largely unsolved. See the notebook for more details and some nice plots.
